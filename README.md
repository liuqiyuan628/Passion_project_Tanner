Part1 of the passion project

Hi Christine,

I have done some part of my passion project based on the Youtube video listed on your ZooApplication readme file and class content.
I've finished the basic CRUD function(like ZooApplication_2) but still need more time to work on the ViewModels and Relationships.

I tried muiltible times on ViewModels and Relationships, but I got a lot of errors from Visual Studio, and I don't know how to fix it. 
Therefor, I start my project over again, and that's what I have done for now.
I think I have to watch your Youtube Videos and lecture recording couple more times.

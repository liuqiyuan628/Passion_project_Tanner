# Passion_project_Tanner
Part1 of the passion project

I have done some part of my passion project based on the Youtube video listed on your ZooApplication readme file and class content. <br/> <br/>
I've finished the basic CRUD function(like ZooApplication_2) but I am stuck on the Update and Delete function little bit now,  <br/> and I still need more time to work on the ViewModels and Relationships.

I tried multiple times on ViewModels and Relationships, but I got a lot of errors from Visual Studio, and I don't know how to fix it.  <br/> <br/>
Therefore, I start my project all over again, and that's what I have done for now.  <br/> <br/>
I think I have to watch your Youtube Videos and lecture recordings a couple more times.  <br/>
